# DPCStatCollector
Personal project. Python data collection / analytics program which uses the OpenDotA API and the DotA2 Dev public APIs to aggregate information from the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC). 

## Current State
Early development. Included will be my attempt at a bunch of smaller Python scripts to work on gathering data. Visualization and organization of the data will be the next step. Currently unsure about how I'm going to store the data assuming I'm going to eventually be running it on a web server.

## Moving Forward
Will eventually will be expanded to include an intuitive UI, access via my personal website, and bi weekly reporting to the DotA2 subreddit. These are all future goals.
